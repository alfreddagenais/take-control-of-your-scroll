# Take control of your scroll - Chrome Extension

Sick of websites hijacking your scrolling? More and more sites are abusing overflow:hidden to prevent scrolling in the main window until you do some unwanted action.

So I made this Chrome extension to take back control of the scroll. Disables annoying scroll hijacking. Make scrolling bearable again by disabling scroll jacking across the web.

This extension that will automatically override this to restore the scrollbar to the main window
